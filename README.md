> [!IMPORTANT]
> This workflow is universal. You need to have a certain foundation in writing github workflows and a little knowledge of the Android kernel to use this.

## How to use?
- First, you need to determine the kernel source code and configuration files.
- Find your kernel source repository and configure the workflow file according to the following example and README.md:

```yml
name: CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-kernel:
    name: Build Kernel
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Build
        uses: dabao1955/kernel_build_action@main
        with:
          kernel-url: https://github.com/AcmeUI-Devices/android_kernel_xiaomi_cas
          kernel-branch: taffy
          config: cas_defconfig
          arch: arm64
          aosp-gcc: true
          aosp-clang: true
          android-version: 12
          aosp-clang-version: r383902
```
Or use the [preset workflow file](https://github.com/dabao1955/kernel_build_action/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) to modify it.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to fork this repository.
>
> If you just want to compile the kernel, please do not submit PR after modification!

- Finally, run the workflow you just wrote.
## Inputs
> [!WARNING]

## FAQ
> [!CAUTION]
> Please Read this first if you have some questions!

### How to use 3rd clang？
You should disable aosp-clang and android-ndk options to use it.

### Why KernelSU version built with this action is still v0.9.5？
See [KernelSU 's release note](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for more details.

### Why the workflow exits with a code with an error value of some nubmer？
- If you get an error while downloading the toolchain or pulling the source code, please check whether your option or source code address is legitimate.
- If you encounter problems during compilation, consider replacing the source code or replacing the compiler.

### Build failed while using third-party GCC ?
Try add LLVM=1 option with clang.
